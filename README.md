# Ember Shortcuts

[![Version!](https://img.shields.io/apm/v/ember-shortcuts.svg?style=flat-square)](https://atom.io/packages/ember-shortcuts)

## Description
This Atom package is based on the [Ember CLI Helper](https://github.com/apprentus/atom-ember-cli-helper) Atom package,
which is sadly no longer maintained. I only used the shortcuts available in that package so I decided to create my
own and maintain the smaller feature set.

## Available Keyboard Shortcuts
| Keybinding                                          | Action                                                     |
| :--                                                 | :--                                                        |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd>     | Toggles between javascript and handlebars files for components and controllers. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>     | Toggles between the controller and route. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd>     | Jumps to the generated test file for the current file. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Jumps into the first component detected on the active row of your editor. |
